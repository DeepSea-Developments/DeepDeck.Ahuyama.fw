# Congratulations!

You now have DeepDeck! now what?

First step is to connect it to the computer or phone.

To do so, browse in the bluetooth functionality of your device, and look for "Ahuyama". after pairing is ready to go!

## First test

The easiest test and should work on any device, is to move the left knob and you should be able to see the volumen of your devce change.

The other keys might not do anything, or just weird things. To configure, go first to the [installing](vscode-setup.md) section to set up the environment, and after that, explore the [configuration](deepdeck-configuration.md) to set your own layers, macros and shortucuts.
