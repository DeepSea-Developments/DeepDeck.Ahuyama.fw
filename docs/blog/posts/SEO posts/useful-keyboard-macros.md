Keyboard macros, also known as keystroke macros, are a series of automated commands that can be executed with a single keystroke or command. Think of macros as your digital assistant, capable of performing repetitive tasks at the push of a button. 

## **How to set up useful macros for your keyboard**

Setting up macros may sound daunting, but it's surprisingly simple. Most modern keyboards come with software that allows you to record and assign macros effortlessly. Alternatively, operating systems like Windows and macOS offer built-in tools for creating and managing macros. With just a few clicks, you can record your desired actions, assign them to a key or combination, and watch as your productivity soars.

## **Examples of good keyboard macros:**

The possibilities with macros are virtually endless. Need to type out your email signature with a single keystroke? There's a macro for that. Want to open multiple programs simultaneously with a single command? You guessed it – macros have you covered. From automating mundane tasks to supercharging your gaming experience, macros are the ultimate multitasking tool.

## **Benefits of using macros:**

The benefits of incorporating macros into your [workflow optimization](https://deepdeck.co/blog/workflow-optimization-and-automation/){:target="_blank"} needs are manifold. By automating repetitive tasks, **macros not only save you time** but also reduce the risk of errors and inconsistencies. Plus, with the ability to customize and tailor macros to your specific needs, you're in complete control of your computing experience. Say goodbye to tedious manual input and hello to newfound efficiency.

Now, these macros can be configured on your keyboard, or with the help of a macropad ([what is a macropad](https://deepdeck.co/blog/macropad-definition/){:target="_blank"}). Let’s see some of the best keyboard macros you can use on your computer.
