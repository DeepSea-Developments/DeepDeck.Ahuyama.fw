## **1. Create an hourly work plan**

Few people know that it’s important to plan the day before starting work hours. It’s not a matter of controlling everything, rather, it is about knowing what to do at specific times of the day. 

Mapping out your tasks and activities hourly can provide structure and clarity to your day. By creating a detailed work plan, you can prioritize your tasks, allocate time for breaks, and ensure you stay on track to meet your goals.


## **2. Deadlines matter**

Setting deadlines for your tasks can help create a sense of urgency and accountability. Establishing clear deadlines for each project or task can motivate you to stay focused at work and efficiently meet your goals on time.

In this case, you won’t deviate from your current activities if anything shows up since you already defined what task you need to complete.

## **3. Organize your work environment**

A messy or disorganized workplace can be a major source of distraction. Take the time to organize your workspace, both physically and digitally, to create a conducive environment for focus and productivity.

Remove unnecessary clutter, keep essential items within reach, and maintain a clean and tidy workspace. And hey, if you really need the extra space, maybe it's time to consider asking for a bigger office! *(Just kidding... or am I?)*.

## **4. Take short breaks**

While it may seem counterintuitive, taking regular breaks can actually improve your focus and productivity. Schedule short breaks throughout your day to rest and recharge, whether it's going for a walk, practicing mindfulness, or simply stepping away from your desk for a few minutes. These brief breaks can help prevent burnout and keep your mind fresh and alert.

If you still wonder how to focus better at work, this is a great tip to implement. **A tired mind won’t perform well after hours in front of a screen.**

## **5. Special tip for being focused: Turn off notifications**

Constant notifications from email, social media, and other apps can be a major distraction and disrupt your focus. *Have you ever been in a situation where you are about to solve an issue, you got the idea out of nowhere but then a phone notification interrupts your thoughts and you lose it?*

Well, it will probably take a while until you get that idea back (hopefully). If you want to work focused, consider turning off non-essential notifications or using features like "Do Not Disturb" mode to minimize interruptions during demanding work periods.

Ok, but you may think, when do I check my emails and messages? You could set a specific time of the morning to do so, and that way, you won’t interrupt your progress or inspiration.

!!! Tip 
    Constant notifications from email, social media, and other apps can be a major distraction and disrupt your focus.

## **6. Take regular breaks**

While it may seem counterintuitive, taking regular breaks can actually improve your focus and productivity. Schedule short breaks throughout your day to rest and recharge, whether it's going for a walk, practicing mindfulness, or simply stepping away from your desk.

You can use 15 minutes just to go for some water, and breathe some air, and that will give a new boost to your mind; it truly works.

## **7. Practice mindfulness**

How to focus better at work with mindfulness? Well, these techniques can help you stay present and concentrate on the task at hand. Take a few moments throughout your day to practice mindfulness exercises such as deep breathing, body scans, or focused attention meditation. This can be done at the same time you take a short break.

## **8. Know your software**

## **9. Minimize multitasking**

While multitasking may seem like a way to get more done, it can hinder your ability to stay focused and perform tasks effectively. According to a study published in 2010 called [Supertaskers](https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/PBR.17.4.479){:target="_blank"}, *“only 2.5% of people can multitask effectively”*. Also, some research indicates that constantly shifting our focus between tasks, particularly when they are complex and demand our full attention, leads to decreased efficiency and a higher likelihood of errors.

**So, Instead of “focusing” on several activities, try to do one task at a time and give it your full attention.** You'll likely find that you're able to accomplish more in less time when you concentrate on one task at a time.

We understand that every job is unique, with varying demands in terms of effort and time required to complete tasks. However, by incorporating the nine tips outlined in this article for staying focused at work, you'll be well-equipped to achieve peak performance in your professional activities.
