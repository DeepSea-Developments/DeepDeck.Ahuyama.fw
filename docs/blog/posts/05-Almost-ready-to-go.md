Hi DeepDeck supporters!

We are very excited to announce that we are almost ready to ship! We had a couple of delays on components acquisition, but we've already received everything. We are now in the assembly and testing phase. We want you to have the DeepDeck in your hands! But, we don't want to rush the testing process, so we'll make sure everything is going to work as it should! We will be shipping the packages to Crowd Supply in about two weeks, and then they will deliver to all the supporters from their warehouse!

## Switches and other fixes!

Another update is that we integrated a switch into the design. Although DeepDeck does not come with a battery, it does have a connector to connect [this kind of battery] (https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13855). The switch will help save the battery, and we plan to integrate further options for battery savings!
There was also an issue with the USB C connector. USB-C to USB-C cables did not work (but are now fixed) and we had a weird case of one-sided USB-C (only when you put the cable in one position, the PC detected it for programming). Everything is now solved and you can use it with any cable in any position, as it should be.

## Team behind DeepDeck

DeepDeck was born as an internal project for our company, DeepSea developments. And the idea still stands. With this production, we will give all of our teammates a DeepDeck so they can use it in the everyday job (Developers, admin, sales, marketing) This will ensure that we will be making new layouts, new updates for different use cases, and we will also hear from the community and integrate all the cool things you do with the DeepDeck! :D
