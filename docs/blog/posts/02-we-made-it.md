We are very happy to announce that our project has been funded! (147% funded at the moment of this publication!) Thanks to all the backers that made this possible and Crowd Supply for supporting and hosting our project!

## What Comes Next?

We are committed to make DeepDeck "a macropad like you've never seen before". To that end, we will be releasing new updates and videos about:

- How to customize the look of your DeepDeck: a tutorial on how to do your own resin keycaps!
- How to integrate API services like Notion!
- Controlling other devices (beside your computer)!

We will also have some gifts for our backers, including multiple 3D enclosure designs and other goodies we'll be announcing in the coming weeks!
