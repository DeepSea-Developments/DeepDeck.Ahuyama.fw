# Thank you very much for supporting DeepDeck!!

DeepDeck started as a small project and now we have a succesfull crowdfunding campaign! And this is just the start.

DeepDeck is a live project, we will be continue releasing new features and want to create a community so all of us (including you) can help improve it, with ideas for features, new ways of using it, new layers ideas!

The core of our community is our [discord channel](https://discord.gg/9cMr75TA8k). There you can ask for help, share layers, etc.

To get started you can visit the quick start guide section to:
- Update DeepDeck firmware (A must to take all the advantage of it)
- Download the UI so you can configure your DeepDeck
- Review other things like code, other applications, so you can get inspired :D

To see other resources we have, social media, etc, you can visit [this link](https://linktr.ee/deepdeck).
