# Configure DeepDeck

As DeepDeck is OpenSource you can change anything about it. On this page, you will see the basic functionalities, regarding layers, key binding, macros, and knobs.

This configuration can be made using the internal webpage (coming soon) but meanwhile, you can follow these steps:

- [Layer Configuration](../layer-configuration)
- [Macros configuration](../macro-configuration)
- [Knob configurations](../knob-configuration)
