# Congratulations!

You now have DeepDeck! Now what?

First step is to connect it to the computer or phone.

To do so, browse in the bluetooth functionality of your device, and look for "Ahuyama". After pairing is ready to go!

## First test

The easiest way to test is to move the left knob. You should be able to see the volume of your device change.

The other keys might not do anything, or just weird things. To configure, go first to the [installing](vscode-setup.md) section to set up the environment, and after that, explore the [configuration](deepdeck-configuration.md) to set your own layers, macros and shortcuts.
