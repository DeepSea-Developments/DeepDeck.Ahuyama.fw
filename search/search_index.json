The USB cable is for serial communication, not the HID protocol that normal keyboards use. In order to allow this, there should be a program in the computer that takes the serial (UART) signals from the deepdeck and convert them into key strokes.</p> <p>Complete answer: The ESP32 used does not have a integrated USB driver. That's why we have a chip that converts from UART to USB, but only the serial protocol, not the HID one needed for a keyboard. As the developer answer states, it would be possible to have a \"gateway\" program that does this, but have to run always on the main device (computer).</p> Is there an arduino version of the firmware? <p>We are working on it. Not yet the # 1 priority, but we are working on it.</p> <p>We are reviewing 2 options:</p> <ul> <li>Building the code from scratch</li> <li>Taking the c code and encapsulate it to work with arduino. If you have experience with this and want to help, send us a message deepdeck@dsd.dev</li> </ul> Can I put a battery on DeepDeck <p>Yes, but be read this carefully.</p> <p>When we released DeepDeck we left the battery connector and charger circuit working BUT the code is not optimized yet to have a battery. This means that you should use a battery with protection to avoid discharging it below the recommended level. Also code will not enter sleep mode or other elements to reduce consumption. We will work on this in the near future.</p> Are the switches hot-swappable? <p>Yes, you can use MX style switches and change them.</p> Does each key has an RGB LED? <p>Yes, and there are 2 additional RGB leds for showing status.</p> Does the DeepDeck has an enclosure? <p>DeepDeck design allows a relatively safe use with the PCB (printed circuit board) base that protect the main electronic board.

DeepDeck is an open source mechanical macropad with 16 mechanichal keys, 2 rotary encoders (knobs) with push buttons and a gesture sensor.  You will help me to create different layers for using it with different softwares. You have to follow the following rules:\n1. When I ask you about a program, like photoshop, return a list of most used shortcuts of the program\n2. Give me the list of possible options, so i can have a base\n3. I will do changes and help.\n\nThis is an example of a layer, but before remember this rules:\n1. There are 16 keys organized in 4 rows and 4 columns. For each key you should put a name (related to the function) and the corresponding key (i.e. \"a\") or the macro (i.e ctrl+alt+c).\n2. There are 2 knobs. Each knob has 5 possible gestures, each gesture with a key or macro  related. The gestures are: turn clockwise, turn counterclockwise, single press, double press, and long press.\n3. To name the layers begin from the top left and go from left to right and from up to down. For example k11 is the first key in the top left of the DeepDeck (first row, first column).  K32 would be the key in row 3, column 2.\n3. All the layers should have a key name [layer] which is used to change the layers. It is normally located in k14.\n\nThis is the example:\n\nLayer: Photoshop Shortcuts\n\nKey Layout:\n\n1. k11 (Ctrl+Z) - Undo\n2. k12 (Ctrl+X) - Cut\n3. k13 (Ctrl+C) - Copy\n4. k14 ([Layer])\n5. k21 (Ctrl+V) - Paste\n6. k22 (Ctrl+S) - Save\n7. k23 (Ctrl+A) - Select All\n8. k24 (Delete)\n9. k31 (Ctrl++) - Zoom In\n10. k32 (Ctrl+-) - Zoom Out\n11. k33 (B) - Brush Tool\n12. k34 (E) - Eraser\n13. k41 (C) - Crop\n14. k42 (V) - Move Tool\n15. k43 (Ctrl+Z) - Undo\n16. k44 (Ctrl+Shift+Z) - Redo\n\nKnob 1 Gestures:\n\n1. Turn Clockwise - Increase Brush Size (])\n2. Turn Counterclockwise - Decrease Brush Size ([\n3. Single Press - Switch to Next Brush (, or .)\n4. Double Press - Reset Brush to Default Size\n5. Long Press - Toggle Brush Tool (B)\n\nKnob 2 Gestures:\n\n1. Turn Clockwise - Increase Zoom Level (Ctrl++)\n2. Turn Counterclockwise - Decrease Zoom Level (Ctrl+-)\n3. Single Press - Fit to Screen (Ctrl+0)\n4. Double Press - Zoom to 100% (Ctrl+1)\n5. Long Press - Toggle Hand Tool (Space)\n\n------------\n\nHelp me create a layer for Inkscape.

The figure below shows the typical organization, where Master, or main have the latest stable code, and most of the time it is tagged. Develop is where the magic happens, but it also have the feature branches to be more organized.</p> <p>For example, I'm implementing a new feature in DeepDeck called TapDance. I would make a branch from develop to feature/tapdance.
